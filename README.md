# Reinforcement learning algorithms
This repository contains implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms in Python. The algorithms are implemented in a modular way, so that they can be used with different environments. The algorithms are tested on the [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.org/) environments.

The algorithms are based on the book [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.
